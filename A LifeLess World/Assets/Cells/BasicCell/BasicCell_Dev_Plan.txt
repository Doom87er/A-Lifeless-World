currently not very good at moving energy from one basic cell to another in an equivilent exchange. should add a way to move energy from one cell to another without a net increase or loss of energy

probably make a way for basicCell's to use energy to make more cell's
-Basic cells should be the easiest to replicate

add ways to turn basicCells into other types
