Notes:
-Main function should be moving energy
-Secondary function should be general utility
-Basic cells should be the easiest to replicate

Current Behavior:
-reverses direction when hitting a feeder cell or another basic cell
  (should change this so it will allways reverse its direction unless special conditions)

-energy manipulation with other basic cells
  this is kinda complex but I like how it works. here is a chart
  (cell_1 energy = cell_2 energy) THEN (cell_1 +1 energy) (cell_2 +1 energy)
  (cell_1 energy > cell_2 energy) THEN (cell_1 -1 energy) (cell_2 +1 energy)
  (cell_1 energy < cell_2 energy) THEN (cell_1 +1 energy) (cell_2 -1 energy)

-becomes feeder cell if 20 or more energy and interacts with basic cell


Plans for Behavior:
-become "energy producing" cell when 20 or more energy and interacts with feeder cell

(Doom87er): the behavior script for this cell is a mess. I'll try to clean it up and i'll be sure to leave lots of notes.
from now on this should be our referance for all other cells, so i'll be sure to leave as many notes on how to impliment changes/referances with respective files.
