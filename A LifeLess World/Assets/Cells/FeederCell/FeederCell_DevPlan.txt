Notes:
-this cell should be easy to make and manipulate
-since this cell will be very important in early stages for making resorces to work with, this cell should be hard to kill or move by accident
-this cell's main function should be producing simple cell's
-this cell's function should be trivialized by more advanced cells (don't want the player to get annoyed by constantly building the same structure)

current behavior:
-will allways take 1 energy away from basic cell's if able

-produces a basic cell moving in a random direction directly abouve it's self once it has 10 energy

plans for behavior:
-when making a basic cell, the produced cell should move in a straight line away from the parent cell on the samw plane
 (should also check for obstruction)


(Doom87er):the texture i made for this has a really bad contrast, but I think it would work better if it was animated
