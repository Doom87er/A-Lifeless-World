# A-Lifeless-World

A Game All about giving life to the empty void through complex patterns created from the interactions bettween "cells"

what we have so far:
 some extremly basic cells whose current behavior is mostly just an "idea" of how they should function
  -Basic Cell
    -The simpliest and most versitile Cell
    -Main function is to move energy from one cell to another
    -can produce energy slowly, or slowly remove energy
    -can be "upgraded" into more specialized cells
    
  -Feeder Cell
    -A cell specialized in producing more cells
    -turns a small amount of energy into basic cells
  
 rudimentery graphics
  -current graphics exists mainly to give an idea of what things "should" look like
  -also to expose any graphic flaws
  
what we have planned:
  more varieties of cells
    -Parasite
      -A hostile cell that attaches to other cells and changes their functions
      -make feeder cells produce parasites instead of basic cells
    
    -Supplier Cell
      -Makes producing energy easier
      
    -Symbiote?
      -the opposite of the parasite, does good things for your cells
      
  an actuall reason to play
    -not to sure what the "end goal" for the player should be
      -"end goal" *needs* to have a clear path for the player to follow in order to keep consitent progress
      -the player should be encourged to deviate from this path and get creative
      -perhaps a puzzle like game with progressivly more chalenging senarios?

TODO:
  -add folder for graphics
  -add README for information on graphics
